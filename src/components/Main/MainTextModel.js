            <h1>WORKING TOGETHER TO MAKE MORE SUSTAINABLE ENVIRONMENTS</h1>
            <p><span className="accent">THE URBAN COLLABORATIVE, LLC</span> is an interdisciplinary design firm that focuses on helping our clients achieve their sustainability goals through engaging, educational, and efficient participatory processes tailored to each project’s scale, context, and culture. Our award-winning work addresses environmental, fiscal, and social sustainability in ways that support and enhance our clients’ missions. While we complete private sector work for clients committed to advancing sustainability, most of our work is for U.S. federal agencies including the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Department of Defense. The Urban Collaborative also works on U.S. federal civil works projects prioritizing resilient systems by integrating regional master planning with capacity building among stakeholders. This includes teaching master planning PROSPECT courses to federal planners and practitioners. We have helped craft national policies, we teach from those policies, and we prepare plans aligned with those policies. Additionally, we focus on municipal planning for cities and counties throughout the country.</p>
